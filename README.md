# Stanford ML Project CS229'18: epsilon

# 1 Abstract
<br><br>We envision using cutting-edge machine learning techniques and novel features to deliver higher accuracy predictions for assignees. During the duration of this project, we will focus on reducing the prediction error and view this project as an Application Result. In the future, we envision capabilities to infer priority and generalize the model to work with EHR diagnosis prediction, ticket triaging for customer support, bug reports, and exception tracking.
